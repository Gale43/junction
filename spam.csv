Sure Jaidev will add same.,0
Just Added the slides from one of our previous talks. It was on introduction to Deep Learning. The PyCon talk will be more about python methods / libraries to implement such algorithms.,0
"A detailed description breaking down the talk into smaller sections with more detailed description would be great!  These are [some examples][1] of proposals with detailed descriptions.

GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY in his computation investment part 1 course. This subject is interesting and will be useful. Incidentally the professor is also conducting many interesting courses on automation/machine learning. For instance for a large world wide manufacturer like Brachot Hermant NV Belgium, it will be useful to use data on raw blocks and color area to predict the rejects in the final polished slabs etc.

Please add a detailed outline of how and what you plan to share to the audience.,0
"Hi Konark,

Good to hear your viewpoint. I think, it is a pythonic talk because:

* Shinken is a 100% python project. The package is available in PyPi (pip install shinken).
* It has a very modular design. Even the default web UI is a separate python module. Installed using shinken installer (shinken install webui).
* Plugins can be written in any language, including python. I have some of mine in a [github repo](https://github.com/rohit01/nrpe-plugins).

\> *Can you try write shed some more light if you can suit it more to pythonic audience. ?*  
I see a lot of talks, which talks about how python is being used instead of talking about the syntax. This talk presents shinken, a tool built using python, its high level architecture and demonstrates how it is better than Nagios (written in C).

Thanks",0
"Vagrant is for every web developer or designer. So I think this talk is for everyone in the conference.
My PRUG meetup talk was just a getting started with vagrant.
But here I am planning to use Django project for demo and will play with it using vagrant.
I am planning to show how we can deploy app on cloud using vagrant.
Nowadays we have complex server architectures.
I will show how we can have different django web and database server And how they communicate with each other.

"They will get a insight on how OpenCv gets more easier by using python. Simply , how more one can achieve by writing less and simple code.",0
This talk needs to be more focussed. Talking about all the points mentioned in 30 minutes will not be possible in a useful fashion.,0
Thanks. That clarifies it a little but I think a rough outline of what you're going to present will help us to understand what you're going to be talking about. Is this about using some kind of FFI to call openCV functions from within Python?,0
"Yes FFi is the solution on one hand but  what we can do is write complete newpython libraries that can be used for some basic operations that take a lot of lengthy lines of code in c++. Making it short and simple will be the key in the talk.

"Hi Kushal,

What other details do you want in the talk proposal. I will upload the slides in another few days.

Thanks and regards,

"So, is your talk about reimplementing some parts of OpenCV in pure python?",0
"This is what actually I was looking for, thanks man good job :) ",0
"Hi Annapoornima,
Can you clarify what is the purpose of this IoT solution? What is the problem you are trying to address?
Kind regards",0
great work !!,0

"This proposal is selected to be for an ""Advanced"" audience. Would it be possible to add the expected outcome for the audience? As in, at the end of this presentation, what are the things they would be able to achieve?",0
"A small set of comments - is this an overview of the experiences and challenges faced by the presenters or, does this talk intended to guide the audience (real-time) into submitting patches into the OpenStack project? Also, it does not seem very clearly articulate about how it aligns with the general theme/focus of PyCon.",0
"This presentation is slated for an audience classified as ""Intermediate"". I'd request that the speaker (re)consider the agenda of the talk. The first two items should be provided as (pre)talk requirements and the various challenges/complexities of deploying a number of (choosing a wider pattern of applications would be great!) applications in the target environment would be a good place to start from. From thereon, moving to aspects of application lifecycle maintenance, security, availability/resiliency etc would be good-to-have topics.",0
"""Measuring Semantic Similarity between sentences in Python"" should probably read ""Using Python to measure semantic similarity between sentences"".

There's been a number of approaches on similar topics using nltk - if you'd like to cite them for the audience to have a conceptual grasp of the problem domain you are trying to address, it would be nice to do.",0
"Do you happen to have a list of useful websites which could be scraped and such? I am suggesting that a bunch of ""ToDo"" or, ""Now that we have shared our knowledge, how about you/the audience consider working on these sites"" kind of list.",0
The proposal (as read here) does not seem to clearly articulate the outcome for the audience - what would they be able to do after this talk?,0
"The proposal (as read in the current form) does not provide adequate detail about the expected outcome for the audience - what would they be able to do at the end of the talk? Also, the scope of the topic would need some re-think. ""Core Python"" sets off expectations of deep/technical discussion around specific aspects of the programming language/design and at present the talk is a list of topics which should be available to anyone with access to documentation.",0
"The prerequisites section could do with further detail. ""Basic knowledge"" could mean a variety of things and the audience should be clear about the expectations being set up by the speaker.",0
"The proposal does not have adequate detail about the outcome from this talk - what can the audience get done after this talk? Also, the prerequisites section is somewhat vague.

The current form of the proposal seems to be about ""how to use Ansible for consistent deployments"" while the ML systems are a workload specific aspect of it. Perhaps the author would (re)consider the description.",0
Sure I am adding outcome for the audience to description. ,0
@sankarshan The talk would enable the audience to actually get acquainted with the two above-mentioned architectures and get in a position to make a well informed decision to zero down on following either of the practice in accordance with their needs and purposes . The talk also would give them clarity on the decision to adapt a framework amidst the available python based frameworks .  ,0
"I've recently wrote a blog post for ""Getting started with scraping in python"". The site I used for my tutorial is this ""Pycon India 2016"" site itself. Please have a look at it http://satwik.ghost.io/2016/06/19/any/ . <- This is the temporary link as of now. 
Regarding useful sites to scrape, there's no limit to that. A rule of thumb may be ""Whenever you want to use some data that any website is displaying, but that website doesn't have an API then you should scrape."" For example,  you can scrape bookmyshow.com for list of events in your area, Flipkart for making sites like buyhatke, cricbuzz for getting cricket statistics and score and so on. However, I'll make a list of all the practical applications I could think of and upload a link to it soon. Thanks for your suggestions by the way :).",0
There's a fine line between scraping a site and DOSing a site. Please explain to the audience the importance of not accidentally bringing the site down.,0
"I would request that you re-visit the intended audience. I agree with your premise that Python's adoption and popularity is increasing. However, the order in which you desire the audience may just be too niche/difficult for a PyCon (and I'd be happy to be proven wrong). Instead, if you focus on the newbies and demonstrate Python's ability to be extended into calculation of risk and such, you'd probably have an audience who are hooked (there have been previous instances where risk analysis etc have been great talks).",0
"I'd suggest that you assume that the audience is aware of the first two topics (in your proposal) and for the subsequent items, please provide a link to a dataset of reasonable size which you'd be working with and they can tinker around to reach similar results.",0
"Do you intend to take a specific case and walk the audience through the problems and solutions in order to arrive at this stack? Or, is it an overview of how the components fit together?",0
"Thanks, sure that helps",0
"The typo in the title would need to be fixed. That aside, would you be using a mock application to demonstrate the test paths (along with how the actual code can be written better to aid testing)? Or, is this a general overview?

It is intended at an ""Advanced"" level, but the proposal does not seem to address any of the topics which an advanced user of such a flow will be faced with.",0
"The current set of topics being covered in this proposal would appeal to a beginner rather than an intermediate practitioner. Would you like to add more detail about complexities and challenges involved in building such an infrastructure or, is this a general overview?",0
Its neither of those.  1 would be a sales pitch for SPA with redux as solution. 2 would just be an overview. The talk delves into much finer technical details mentioned in bullet points in the description. Let me know if you have any further queries. Happy to answer them. ,0
"I noticed that there is a workshop proposal with the same title - are these two unique bits or, the same thing? Building hyperlocal weather sensors is an interesting exercise. Do you intend to cover how your audience can DIY and how it can be useful for them?",0
"I wanted to check if you have previously presented on this topic at any local meetup. This is an interesting proposal and often, these form of proposals evolve if the speaker has been discussing these over a period of time.",0
It would be good to have a link to the dataset you'll be using as part of the demo. The audience can choose to continue after the talk and learn.,0
"I'd recommend turning this talk on its head. Instead of ""a gentle introduction to Ansible"" (which is a good thing, but fairly mundane), how about building up good habits in beginners and showing them how some of the common problems/pitfalls from code -> deploy can be managed via Ansible?",0
"Hi Sankarshan:

Yes, I am sorry for the typo, I meant Beginner's level only, I will change the level, basically the talk would just need a basic understanding or awareness of AWS EcoSystem and its components. 

Regards,
Suman++",0
"Thanks,  I've added a slide for 'Ethics of Scraping' :)",0
Fixed..,0
"Yes i would take a demo application and run thru the end to end testing of API using requests and unittest module.

The Description of the talk is updated accordingly",0
"@Sankarshan, I want to present a talk and do a workshop as well. Talk is preferable. If time permits and if I have people to do the DIY workshop, I am for it.

@misccold, I am presenting how to collect temperature data and pass it on to the Raspberry Pi. Further, there are a plethora of things that can be done with data, some of the things that I can think on top of my head are, display heat maps, develop home automation tools, etc. Sky is just the beginning for limits.",0
"Hey Sankarshan, thanks for asking. I have discussed about these topics with my colleagues and friends many times. Previously i have given a bunch of talks in few colleges and other meetups. My previous talks revolved around IoT and python mostly. In next month's ChennaiPy meetup, i will be giving a talk on the above proposed topic.",0
"The goal is to guide attendees through the contribution process and encourage them that given the open nature of open source communities (in terms of documentation, guidelines, bug triage, help on IRC, review feedbacks), it becomes really simple to get acquainted with the workflow quickly and make an initial first contribution and then go on making more contributions slowly and gradually as you learn more.

Since OpenStack is a Python based Open Source Project that is why we submitted the proposal under the Other Category.",0
"You have written in your first line ""This workshop"" but categorized it in the form of talk. Is it suppose to be a talk or a workshop?",0
"I had a confusion between a workshop and a talk, since the way I see it, my proposal lies between workshop and a talk. Still thanks for pointing this out. I will edit it.",0
"It seems more apt for a workshop to me! Btw, nice proposal, looking forward for it :)",0
"CI is a must feature for any git repo and having it on pagure is a must

I am interested in attending this talk",0
"Hi @megha , than you for submitting the proposal, is it possible for you to share the video / slides for the events you have spoken in the past.

Looking at the description it seems to be more oriented towards MySQL, can these ""Best pracitices"" be applied to any DB or specifically MySQL.  What is specific to python in this talk or does it revolve around databases only ?

"Thank you for your submission. While the proposal, and your slides look fine as they stand, I have two questions/suggestions:
* Your slides cover basic graph theory. How about adding:
   - Some example usages of graph networks in real life in order to motivate your audience
   - Some advanced examples of real-life problems that are more tractable to solutions through graph networks; maybe contrasting graph networks to more commonly used relational databases
* Why a workshop? Is there enough material that cannot be covered in 40min., and needs 2-3 hours?",0
"Thanks for showing interest. I have explained that basic knowledge of Selenium, Python and HTML is needed.  Audience can expect a simple and helpful talk, which will help them to get data  by themselves for their projects.  ",0
"Thank you sir for your humble suggestion. We will be adding some real life implementation of network sciences in further slides. we are still preparing the slides. There are many real time examples to discuss and brainstorm that will motivate the audience with great curiosity. we will update the slides by today. 
Yes, we thought of giving some hands on experience to audience in network analysis but if it is not feasible we can shift it as a talk session. We are also planning to add some code snippets that will help attendees to understand the domain at better extent.",0
"""""Thanks for your submission. Please provide more details, as it is difficult to judge from this what is being proposed beyond a basic introduction to app development with Kivy. Kivy has been around for a while, and many people have probably seen introductory talks. What are you going to demonstrate that is new, and why are you suited to making such a presentation.

Please note that time is short.""""

@Reply: Thank you sir for your humble comment. yes, I will be covering the basics along with the development of small ping pong game. In latter part, we will be developing a small git interface application with which we can update and commit the various changes in the code stored in our github repository. Its Functionality might be limited but enough to carry out basic operations like edit,update & commit. Thank you.o",0

"Please add what your talk will cover about MicroPython. It will be a good idea to add talk outline, see https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal_advice/samples/SpacePug/ for an example.",0
It is not clear from the description what you will be covering in your talk. Can you please add a talk outline? See https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal_advice/samples/SpacePug/ for an example.,0
Looks like you trying cram in a lot of things into a single talk. How about focusing on one of them instead?,0

"Thanks for letting me know, fixed the link

those are the reasons this presentation is for but if you cant wait till i attach a presentation to this talk, you can always ping me on the side ",0
"Making things a bit explicit, will increase the chances of your proposal getting selected. Also the talk selection happens before the slide upload deadline. So it is better to beef up the talk description.",0
Is this talk about BDD in general or is it about a particular framework?,0
"sure, will do",0
I have read Kashif's code and discussed some technical aspects with him. It would definitely be useful to pick his mind through this talk. Bumped it up.,0
This is mostly about BDD framework with python and selenium. We are focusing on front-end and back-end automation using python selenium where test cases are in BDD.,0
That's very nice. ,0
Please provide an outline of the workshop. See https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal_advice/samples/SpacePug/ for an example.,0
"It will great if you can break the topics into subtopics and provide an outline of the talk. See https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal_advice/samples/SpacePug/ for an example.

In my opinion, the talk would be interesting if the talk includes real world implementation issues, solutions tried, what worked or what did not, etc. Or how this was used to address a specific real world problem, like in pollution control, outcomes, improvements, etc.",0
"Thanks for the details. Please be aware that the talk duration is 30 min + 10 min for questions. Rather than talking about many different things about Micropython it would be nice to focus on one aspect. For example you might just want to drop of the part three.

In part one, you might just want to focus on those areas that are different in Micropython. For example it would be interesting to talk about Micropython's viper and inline assembler support, and other speed optimizations done in Micropython.

In part two, not sure why you want to use ""few"" different boards. Wouldn't a single type board suffice? You might want to list out the demos you are planning to do.",0
Looks Interesting,0
Looks Interesting,0
"Thanks for review, I changed it to ""beginner"". Topics which you suggested will discuss with interested folks or will propose a session during breakout which will focus on lifecycle management, maintenance, security and availability. ",0
"I don't think that 30 min will be sufficient to talk about the entire internal architecture of Micropython. I think I can start by introducing the board and then starting from simple examples to various code optimization parts like using native code emitters and micropython's viper code emitters. 
I said multiple boards because say if you have esp8266, you can't get the inline assembler functionality( the core is based on Xtensa ) . esp8266 is the cheapest micropython board that you can get online. just for Rs.200. I can cover  those areas using pyboard. I am getting 4 pyboards  next week. :)

If I talk too much about the internals then I am not sure that how many of the audience can catch-up all those. It will be better to cover those areas through examples without opening the ""C"" part of it. 

I wish I could get more suggestions and comments here.

Thank you",0

Internet issues are common at conferences. You should plan to have things working locally, instead. ",0
"As Vijay already pointed out, can you please make the slides publicly viewable?

"I second Vijay's suggestion of beefing up the description. An outline with
finer detail on what you want to cover will go a long way!

If you have slides/videos of any previous talks you have given, that would be
helpful too.",0
"It should be manageable without internet as well.

Just in reply to one of the query thru mail, I will plan to keep this talk as simple as possible to make beginners understand what is REST API and why it is important to test an API in any application first and then making them understand the concepts of testing REST API with the help of GET/POST/PUT/DELETE methods and will detail out the demo scenarios for testing an API and then will go ahead with the use of python libraries(Requests and Unittest) for testing the REST API's.

Also by built-in features of Requests I mean to say how with the help of requests one can GET/POST the data from/to a service and how to validate the API response and how you define the headers/params needed to access the API's. 

Try to keep the talk as simple as possible for the Python Novice to understand

Updated the Pre-requisite accordingly.",0
"Hello Arthy,

Thank you for proposing this talk.

It is not clear which tool you are describing in the description. Is it an open

going to talk about?  What are your take aways from building/using this tool?

"Thank you for the proposal, looks like an interesting topic, I looked at the talk shared and it would be great if you can provide some details on the following questions:

1. How different are you planning this talk to be from the one given at PyDelhi. Please share a concrete plan.
2. Until the example shared by you which talk about the deal codes and it's user, the talk looked fairly simple of How-Tos of various tools, which I will advice to restrain from. The example looked like it's more a porblem of grep's then why this elaborate setup.
3. Since you are one of the largest e-comm companies, it would great to get some insights on numbers, throughput and scale challenges.
4. Please list down the libraries you will be using to talk to various components like elastic-search, Kafka, elastic-alert, map-reduce etc etc.

If not structured well, this talk will be too much in too little time.",0
"You can update the description with the same, that would be great.",0
"Hi,

Please update the description with a proper outline of what the talk is going to be about. 

Can you talk about:

1. Scale at which Apache Storm is being used.
2. Is the use-case mentioned by you a production use-case or ""How to get started with Apache Storm"".
3. What libraries are you planning to share like StreamParse, Pyleus or any other. Why you would choose one over the other ?
4. What kind of deployment strategies do you follow to deploy storm cluster like green/blue deployment strategy or something else ?
5. Since you are mentioning Big Data, will you also cover how Storm cluster can be tuned and configured beyond basic deployment ?

"Hi Vijay, I think we do not use keywords like 'style' or automation 'process' in organizations as we QE's see everything as in every tool as a framework and that is the reason we used the word 'framework'. Also our perspective while presenting the session will be 'Automation' and not developing anything new and we already have implemented it and use it regularly for our Behaviour Driven automation in our team. You can refer the wiki of the same where the keyword 'framework' is used along with BDD many a times: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development . Still, If you want we can change or remove the work 'framework' from the title.. 
Let me know if you have any more questions apart from this.",0

You are right. Lexical analyzer/ Lexer and tokenizer are functionally the same as the original Cpython. But the way Damien wrote these blocks are in a different way compared to the typical cpython implementation.  ,0

"Thanks for your comment. 

 This talk is intended for beginners who wants to know how to get
    started with Apache Storm for Real time Processing. I do use storm
    to process the huge data that we get from multiple sources (Spouts)

The use case that I mentioned (Sentiment Analysis) is just to motivate the attendees towards it. Processing the data (Tweets) that we get from Twitter will be one use case that I will be mentioning in my talk.

I will be using Petrel Library so as to make it simple and easy to build and help others to understand better.

And this will be a basic deployment.

Please update the description.,0
"Hey , thanks for taking interest in my proposal .

About code samples : My talk targets beginners who might know how to code or might not . Considering this case i have tried to keep the code as minimal as possible but have focused a lot on **LIVE DEMO's** and **EXAMPLES** . 

here is an example of how i will explain topics : (

>  this is just an example , i have not given full details here . In
> real talk it would be more graphical and interactive

) 

**XOR** 

1. description

2.  a few properties of XOR 

                           0 ⊕ 0=0        1 ⊕ 0=1
                           0 ⊕ 1=1        1 ⊕ 1=0

3. Bitwise XOR : python provide ^ operator to perform bitwise XOR on integers. It does this by first expressing those two integers in binary  , and then performing XOR on their respective bits. Hence the name, bitwise XOR.

                                    73 ⊕ 87 = 0b1001001 ⊕ 0b1010111

                                1 0 0 1 0 0 1  (left)
                               = ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕
                                  1 0 1 0 1 1 1 (right)
                               = 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
                               = 0b0011110
                               = 30

4. One-time pads : explanation of one time pads . 

5. Attacks on One time pads  : reuse of same key , crib drabbing . 

6. Live example : 

![Plain text][1]

![cipher text][2]

![Reused key and XOR of ciphertext][3]

How the talk will be structured  : the talk will proceed in same way as i have provided in description 

i will start with  XOR ( explain what it is ? , implementation ? , attacks on it ) and will follow the below sequence 

 1. XOR
    
 2.   One TIme Pad
    
 3.  Ciphers : block ciphers , stream ciphers
    
 4.   TLS
    
 5.   Diffiew-Hellman Key exchange
    
 6.   Authenticity
    
 7.   Cryptographic Hash Functions
    
 8.   Password Storage ( brute force , dictionary attacks , salts , bcrypt
    , scrypt )
    
 9.   Public Key Cryptography
    
 10.   Key Generation
    
 11.   Signing ( RSA , chains of signatures , GPG Key Signing )

Can you please provide some concrete examples and problem statements, where you are using this library and the others failed.

1. about structuring the talk for 40 Minutes . I have been doing practice/ rehearsels with my slides and most of the time the talk comes to an end in 35 min . 

2. about ensuring that examples are showcased using python libs  : as I said in my abstract   "" This talk is aimed at programmers of any skill level that lack crypto knowledge. "" I will surely show examples / live demo with python libs but some examples are best explained if they are simple .

"The problem I will discuss is somewhat like:
Currently, OpenStack's end user stories for both command-line and application developer-consumers of OpenStack-based clouds is confusing, fractured, and inconsistent. This means that if a non-operator or OpenStack developer attempts to consume more than a single service from a deployed OpenStack system, they face an uphill battle. With a consumer application requiring potentially 22 individual python-* clients to install, each with different APIs and nuances, it becomes increasingly difficult to consume OpenStack clouds. The python-openstacksdk project proposes a new project with a single API namespace (""OpenStack"") that would provide users with a single point of entry and series of supporting functions/methods from which to build applications and tools. As a side effect of this consolidation, it becomes very easy to derive a unified CLI, such as OpenStack client, or specialized pre-service CLI tools. However, it is important that the definition of SDK -- the compilation of the APIs and developer functions -- and CLI tools stay separate as it is easy to conflate the idea of ""clients,"" which is the state we have today. 
I hope I answer your question.",0
